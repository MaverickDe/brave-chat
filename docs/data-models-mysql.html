                              Essentially, there are <strong>six</strong> primary tables that the platform is built upon: 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>users</strong>: A table containing detailed information about each user who signed into the platform.</li>
                              <li><strong>access_tokens</strong>: A table that keeps track of unique user tokens to ensure only authorized users can log in. It also helps to add a logout functionality on the server side.</li>
                              <li><strong>contacts</strong>: A table contains contacts for each user. A user must have a contact to send a message. The contact act as the receiver of a message.</li>
                              <li><strong>messages</strong>: A table contains sender, receiver IDs and/or room names for every message sent along with information about each message type(e.g. text message or media), the content of the message...</li>
                              <li><strong>rooms</strong>: A table contains information about each room(group); the room name, and a room description. </li>
                              <li><strong>rooms_members</strong>: A table that maps users to rooms joined in.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              There is a one-to-many relationship between <strong>users</strong> and <strong>contacts</strong> tables. A user can have more than one contact.

                              There is a one-to-many relationship between <strong>users</strong> and <strong>rooms</strong>; a user can exist in one or more rooms. There is also a one-to-many relationship between </strong>rooms</strong> and <strong>messages</strong>; a room can have one or multiple messages. The <strong>messages</strong> table contains enough information to populate the messages list between a sender and multiple receivers in the room. The only difference from the previous users-messages model is that the receiver side of the conversation is the room itself; think of the room column as a wildcard, if set, for all receivers.

                              Database Queries
                            </h4>
<p>Now that we have our data modelled, we need to think about how we will query it. As you can see, we have a table for messages and a table for users. If we want to fetch all messages sent between two users, we need to join the two tables like the following:</p>
<pre class="bg-dark text-white ps-4"><code class="lang-sql">
SELECT
    id,
    content,
    CASE
        WHEN sender = :sender_id THEN "sent"
        WHEN receiver = :sender_id THEN "received"
        ELSE NULL
    END as type,
    media,
    creation_date
FROM
    messages
WHERE (
  sender = :sender_id
    AND
  receiver = :receiver_id
)
OR (
  sender = :receiver_id
    AND
  receiver = :sender_id
)
ORDER BY
  creation_date

</code></pre>
<p>However, as you can tell, we have a table for messages and Two tables for rooms. The rooms table holds detailed information about each room. And the <code>room_members</code> table maps users to rooms. This way, we respect the four normalization principles. If you are unfamiliar with normalization, it breaks down data into its smallest possible unit. This ensures that no data is duplicated and that all data is kept in its proper place.</p>
<p>For example, consider one table containing room information and messages. However, this would not be normalized because it would require us to duplicate data in the same table. Instead, we can have a table for rooms and a separate table for <code>room_members</code> which maps users to rooms. This way, we respect the four normalization principles. And, to fetch all messages sent in a room, we can join the two tables:</p>
<pre class="bg-dark text-white ps-4"><code class="lang-sql">
SELECT
    messages.id as msg_id,
    messages.content,
    CASE
        WHEN messages.sender = :sender_id THEN "sent"
        ELSE "received"
    END as type,
    messages.media,
    messages.creation_date,
    users.id as id,
    users.email,
FROM
    messages
LEFT JOIN
    users
ON
  messages.sender = users.id
WHERE
  messages.room = :room_id
ORDER BY
  messages.creation_date

</code></pre>
<p>As you can tell, we need to join two tables whenever we want to fetch messages. This can be slow if the tables are large. However, future releases of the app will consider optimizing all different types of queries that exist in the app. Let&#39;s ignore that for a while.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to add a new column called <code>room</code> to indicate whether it&#39;s a room or an individual recipient. This column would contain the id of the room the messages have been sent to, allowing all recipients to be included. If a user sends a message in a room, the receiver column value would be null, indicating that all recipients in this room should receive the message.</p>
<p>The theory is that there is still a column room with a null value even if the user is just in a one-on-one private chat. Each message they send is directed to that other chat member.</p>
<p>However, the denormalization required for this doesn&#39;t create a risk for update anomalies, so the redundancy isn&#39;t too much of a problem. For example, let&#39;s say you want to run a typical query that answers the question &quot; What are the most recent messages sent to a given user?&quot;. And the answer would be the following:</p>
<pre class="bg-dark text-white ps-4"><code class="lang-sql">
SELECT
  messages.id as message_id,
  content,
  MAX(messages.creation_date) OVER(PARTITION BY users.email) AS last_message_time,
  SUM(status) OVER(PARTITION BY users.email) AS nb_unread_message,
  SUM(status) OVER() AS nb_total_unread_message,
  users.id as id,
  users.email
FROM
  messages
LEFT JOIN
  users
ON
  messages.sender = users.id
WHERE
  messages.receiver = :user_id
